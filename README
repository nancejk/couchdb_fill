A tool to fill a couchdb database with random data for testing purposes.
Hopefully it is simple - the idea is that you create a class in the doc_wrapper.py file that subclasses couchdbkit.python
 with the fields you wish the document to have.  If you want useful data, adding default (randomized) values to these fields 
 is the way I've done it so far.  Then you just need to add that document to the types that the CouchClient class knows about in 
 couch_writer.py, and that's it.  Manual intervention required, but hey, it's a script.

 Options:
 -n number of documents to push at once (default: 100)
 -N total number of documents to push (default: 10000)
 -d name of the database to push to (default: couchfill_test)
 -s IP/hostname of the server where couch resides (necessary, no default)
 -t Document 'type' you wish to push (defined in couch_writer.py, necessary, no default)
